        <p>
          Cutting-edge analytical and research skills are at the heart of every
          solid intelligence project. Highly experienced and trained in Israel’s

        <h4><span class="number">2</span>HARVESTING IN THE CYBER WORLD</h4>
        <p>
          Black Cube has developed innovative tools and methodologies to handle
          massive amounts of data. We unearth useful information for our clients
          and map all potential sources of interest by trawling the deep web and
          harvesting information from typically inaccessible areas of the
          Internet such as the Dark Net.

          speakers of different languages, and a unique understanding of many
          local cultures, the team is uniquely skilled to operate in Europe, the

        <p>
          We have unique experience accessing and analysing information on
          various platforms, including more than 240 limited-access financial,
          commercial, regulatory, legal and technical databases, gaining lawful
          access to new resources in accordance with our clients' needs.

        <h4><span class="number">5</span>PRO-ACTIVE APPROACH</h4>
        <p>
          We overcome limited-access sources by taking a can-do, dynamic
          approach. We have developed several unique methods, especially in the
          social engineering field, that allow us to move freely in and to
          extract valuable information from limited access sources, both in
          virtual and physical environments.

      <div class="content">
        <h4><span class="number">6</span>ETHICAL CONDUCT</h4>
        <p>
          We only use human intelligence to discover the truth and always act
          lawfully in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We do not undertake
          any projects involving violent crime of any kind, including sexual
          harassment. We never use intimidation, blackmail or hacking to obtain
          information, and we only ever record conversations that we are a party
          to. We do not put words into people’s mouths and our recordings are
          never edited to change the meaning of a conversation. Full, unedited
          transcripts of our recordings are always provided to the court.

                Whilst robust defence systems are an essential foundation for any cyber-security plan, it is necessary, in today’s fast-moving world of technology and diverse cyber-threats, to expand the perimeter of security in order to sufficiently safeguard your systems and data. Possession of up-to-date intelligence that allows you to know what to expect in case of an attack, and that provides an ample forewarning to prepare, is the key to an effective response system. Furthermore, swift response and forensic investigation following a cyber-security breach can reduce exposure, recover data and allow for a swift and appropriate recalibration of security measures.

              <h3>
                Uncovering Negative Campaigns
              </h3>
              <p>
                Oftentimes, Black Cube’s clients find their reputation under online attack from adversaries operating anonymously or under an assumed identity. The statements made virtually in blogs, news article comments and on social media can have a very real effect on the reputation of an individual or company. Black Cube unmasks negative campaigns aimed at slandering its clients, including the identities, biases, motivations and conflicts of those making false statements, enabling the clients to take steps to silence them.               
               </p>
              <h3>
                Data Leakage Assessment
              </h3>
              <p>
                Perhaps the greatest risk of data leakage comes from a company’s own employees, be it intentional or accidental. Black Cube works with the client to identify employees that have the potential to leak, or have leaked, information through social media or other, inadvertent, methods of distribution. Coupled with an assessment of employee satisfaction in the highest risk positions, such as IT security officers, this provides the client with a strategic map for dealing with potential data leakage, enabling a swift and appropriate response.               
               </p>
              <h3>
                Active Threat Intelligence
              </h3>
              <p>
                As a premium service, clients with greater security needs may retain Black Cube to be their ‘eyes and ears’ in the world of cyber-crime. By assigning teams that actively engage with the hacker community to keep a 24/7 watch for direct threats to a specific client, Black Cube is able to create a 360 degree picture of threats to the client’s infrastructure. Using their innovative methodology of obtaining information, Black Cube personnel provide real-time bulletins of any critical threat information that is relevant to the client.

              <h3>
                Cyber Forensics
              </h3>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0%;">
                In today’s digital age, the provenance and authenticity of computerised information can be a critical factor in deciding the facts of a case. Black Cube’s cyber forensics team delves deep into metadata – the DNA of digital information – in order to show when documents have been altered or manipulated, provide clues as to the existence of further information that could be discoverable, and establish timelines and patterns of behavior. Furthermore, Black Cube’s cyber forensics experts have the necessary experience and credentials to act as expert witnesses when required.

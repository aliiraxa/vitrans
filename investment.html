                Internal Fraud and Misrepresentation
              </h3>
              <p>
                From financial fraud to conflicted managerial interests, there are many events that can topple a seemingly stable company. Oftentimes, in an attempt to cover up losses or mislead investors, companies will misrepresent themselves publicly. With our wide variety of information collection methodologies, from cyber intelligence to social engineering, deep forensic accounting skills and the linguistic and cultural knowledge to operate in any business jurisdiction, Black Cube is uniquely positioned to discover the truth behind company communications anywhere in the world, from financial statements to production reports.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Our asset identification and valuation services produce valuable intelligence and due-diligence at a standard far beyond other currently available services, whether a client is seeking to understand a company’s base asset structure, wishes to understand the value that will be released in an impending company break-up — or even understand the probability that such a break-up will occur. We operate in various jurisdictions under diverse legal systems, covering analysis of offshore companies and trusts.

                Black Cube produces compliance reports on potential business partners, suppliers, distributors, and re-sellers (individuals and companies), supporting clients’ compliance efforts in accordance with the requirements of the Bribery Act, Fraud Act, Proceeds of Crime Act, and other relevant legislation.

                One can only derive so much from a company’s own published information; careful observation and analysis of both general market information and geopolitical intelligence are required to accurately appreciate a company’s true value. Beyond intelligence on the target company’s competitors, we also assess the broader factors that influence a company’s value. For example, the impact of a possible peace treaty on an arms manufacturer, or impending government regulation on a medical device firm.

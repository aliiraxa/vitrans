                In the rapidly changing environment of today’s business arena, exclusive knowledge constitutes a significant business advantage and a game-changing tool.

                Deep Level Due Diligence
              </h3>
              <p>
                Decisions involving significant business moves, large-scale acquisitions, new partnerships, and expanding operations into new, and foreign, countries inevitably involve trade-offs between risks and benefits. Black Cube’s Deep-Level Due Diligence service supports clients’ risk management and helps minimise such business risks by providing comprehensive assessments of business targets. A distinct tool to financial and legal due diligence, Black Cube’s Deep-Level Due Diligence delves into the people behind the target company; their motives and interests, past behavior in other roles, and any other information that could reveal behaviour contrary to the strategy of Black Cube’s clients.
                <br><br>
                Our unique Deep-Level Due Diligence methodology produces a broad and detailed overview of the designated target, taking into account a multitude of financial, marketing, legal, and technical aspects.              </p>

                Compliance Reports

                <br><br>
                We help our clients ensure full compliance with these laws by inspecting both legal and financial records and procedures of designated partners, in order to confirm their compliance with the requirements defined in relevant legislation, such as due-diligence reporting and risk assessment procedures. Looking into 240 unique databases, our compliance services identify involvement of existing and potential business associates in sanctions violations, money laundering incidents, terror financing and any organised crime involvement.              </p>
